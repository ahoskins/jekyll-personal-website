Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Procedures
-----

> In contrasting iteration and recursion we must be careful not to confuse the notion of a recursive process with the notion of a recursive procedure.  When we describe a procedure is recursive we are referring to the syntantic fact that the procedure defination refers to the procedure itself.  But when we describe a process...we are speaking about how it evolves.

Chapter 2: Building Abstractions From Data
------

> In general, we can think of data as defined by some collection of selectors and constructors, together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to a be a valid representation. (Page 90)

Chapter 3: Modularity, Objects and State
-----

> A language that supports the concept that "equals can be substituted for equals" is an expression without changing the value of the expression is said to be referentially transparent. (Page 232)

---

> The loss of referential transparency, giving rise to a thicket of questions about sameness and change, and the need to abandon the substitution model of evaluation in favor of the more intricate environment model. (Page 297)
