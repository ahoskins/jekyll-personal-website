Web and mobile developer interested in expanding my knowledge and conquering the universe.  Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student at the University of Alberta.  Currently, I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Garmin working on fancy ANT-enabled Android applications.

I spend lots of my spare time using code to build things.  I also like to bike, play basketball and hockey, and listen to music.
