I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student at the University of Alberta.  Currently, I'm an
intern at Garmin working on [ANT](http://www.thisisant.com/) enabled Android applications.

I spend lots of my spare time using code to build things.  I also love to bike, play basketball and hockey, and listen to awesome music.
