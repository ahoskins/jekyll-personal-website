Right now, I'm most interested in front-end development. 
I have experience building [pragmatic and maintained things](https://github.com/ahoskins/Winston), but also love to quickly get 
[stuff done](https://github.com/ahoskins/Snapper) at [Hackathons](https://github.com/ahoskins/grind).
I like to learn about things in the [functional programming world](http://elm-lang.org/), the React [ecosystem](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate), concepts in [design](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/1452654123), and utopian [development workflows](http://zachholman.com/talk/move-fast-break-nothing/).
 
I study Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta, and will graduate in spring 2017.  I've previously interned at [TELUS](www.telus.com) and
[Garmin](http://www.garmin.com/en-US), and I'm excited to be joining [Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com/) in summer 2016.
