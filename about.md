I'm a [Computer Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY&=) student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.  Currently, I'm an
intern on the [ANT+ team at Dynastream Innovations](http://www.thisisant.com/consumer/ant-101/what-is-ant) in lovely Cochrane, Alberta.

My current project is a schedule builder written with [AngularJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfUv0spHCY).  One of my friends, [Ross Anderson](https://github.com/rosshamish), is handling the back-end in Python.  We hope to release it to University of Alberta students in the spring by the time registration opens again.
