Right now, I'm most interested in front-end development. 
I have experiance building [pragmatic and maintained things](https://github.com/ahoskins/Winston), but also like quickly getting 
[stuff done](https://github.com/ahoskins/Snapper) at [Hackathons](https://github.com/ahoskins/grind).
To satisfy my more academic interests in computer science, I like to learn about things in the functional world like Elm, Redux, and ClojureScript &mdash; and I think it makes me a better developer when using boring old JavaScript. 
 
I study Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta, and will graduate in spring 2017.  I've previously interned at [TELUS](www.telus.com) and
[Garmin](http://www.garmin.com/en-US), and I'm very excited to be at [Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com/) this summer.
