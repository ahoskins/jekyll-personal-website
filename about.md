This website is a portfolio/blog which is (clearly) a work in progress.  

I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.  In my space time lately I've been doing
a lot of Angular JS working on a course scheduler project (will be open sourced upon release).  Currently, I work at Dynastream Innovations
where I am a developer on the ANT+ applications team - primarily working with Java on the Android platform.
